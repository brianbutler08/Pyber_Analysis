# Pyber_Analysis

# Overview

As a new employee of Pyber, a ride sharing service, I have been working on an analysis of various datasets related to the company's recent performance. Each ride that the company's drivers administer is tracked in a central database and, after merging datasets, we have access to the following datapoints:

- City in which the ride took place
- Type of city (urban, suburban or rural)
- Data and time of ride
- Total fare for the ride
- Number of Pyber drivers for each city

My colleague, Omar, and I have been working on a series of DataFrame summaries of the data, along with creating some charts and figures. For our final assignment, we were tasked with developing a final DataFrame of the data, organized by the type of city. For each of the three types (urban, suburban or rural) we will provide:

- Total number of rides 
- Number of drivers
- Total fares
- Average fare per ride
- Average fare per driver

After the DataFrame was complete, we were asked to create a line chart that displayed total fare by each city type over a four month timeframe. This will allow management to get a clear understanding about the relative amount of revenue produced by each of the city types when compared to each other and how these revenues might change over time.
